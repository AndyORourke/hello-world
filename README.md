This is my first repository

Hi Reader!

I'm 27 years old as I write this. I'm going to be going back to school to get my bachelor's degree in Computer Science in roughly 3 weeks.

I am incredibly excited and I've created this account so I can share some of projects and help contribute on other projects as well.

Currently, I'm focusing on learning Python on my own time in preperation for school. I'm working through Automate the Boring Stuff with Python. Maybe some of the projects I do through this book will end up here!
